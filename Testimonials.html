<h1>CLIENT TESTIMONIALS</h1>
<h4>Mr.Peter Butere</h4>
<p>I was searching for furniture to furnish my newly built home. I couldn't have been happier I discovered Ibis. I almost spent a whole day choosing from their vast options, settling for one then deciding on another set of furniture. I recommended Ibis to my friends soon after. There is honestly no other place that sells better quality furniture in Nairobi at the moment.</p>
<h4>Mrs.Riri Muhinga</h4>
<p>I bought some sofas at Ibis 5 years ago. I still have them to this day and haven't once thought of replacing them because as I myself grew old in those 5 years, they have surprisingly stood the test of time and look and feel like I bought them just the other day.</p>
